=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Plugin::SizeLimit - Terminate workers that grow too large

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Mojolicious
  if ($ENV{HYPNOTOAD_APP}) {
    $self->plugin('SizeLimit', max_unshared_size => 262_144); # 256M
  }

  # Mojolicious::Lite
  if ($ENV{HYPNOTOAD_APP}) {
    plugin 'SizeLimit', max_unshared_size => 262_144;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::SizeLimit> is a L<Mojolicious> plugin that allows
to terminate L<hypnotoad> worker processes if they grow too large. The
decision to end a process can be based on its overall size, by setting
a minimum limit on shared memory, or a maximum on unshared memory.

Actually, there are two big reasons your L<hypnotoad> workers will grow.
First, your code could have a bug that causes the process to increase in
size very quickly. Second, you could just be doing operations that
require a lot of memory for each request. Since you can't rely that
Perl gives memory back to the system after using it, the process size
can grow quite large.

This module will not really help you with the first problem. For that
you should probably look into "BSD::Resource" or some other means of
setting a limit on the data size of your program. BSD-ish systems have
"setrlimit()", which will kill your memory gobbling processes. However,
it is a little violent, terminating your process in mid-request.

This module attempts to solve the second situation, where your process
slowly grows over time. It checks memory usage after every N requests,
and if it exceeds a threshold, calls L<Mojo::IOLoop/stop_gracefully>,
what as a result makes the worker stop accepting new connections and
terminate as soon as all its pending requests have been processed and
served.

By using this module, you should be able to set the configuration
directive L<Mojo::Server::Hypnotoad/accepts> to 0 (= unlimited).
This has the great advantage, that worker processes are not sig-killed
by the manager process at end-of-life if they do not finish within
L<Mojo::Server::Hypnotoad/graceful_timeout>.

=head1 OPTIONS

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::SizeLimit> supports the following options.

=head2 max_unshared_size

The maximum amount of unshared memory the process can use in KB. Usually
this option is all one needs, because it only terminates processes that
are truly using too much physical RAM, allowing most processes to live
longer and reducing the process churn rate.

On Solaris though unshared size is not available.

=head2 max_process_size

The maximum size of the process in KB, including both shared and
unshared memory. This must be used on Solaris.

=head2 min_shared_size

Sets the minimum amount of shared memory the process must have in KB.

=head2 check_interval

Since checking the process size can take a few system calls on some
platforms (e.g. linux), you may specify this option to check the process
size every N requests.

=head2 report_level

This plugin writes a message when a worker is about to terminate after
reaching a limit. The message is written using the L<Mojo::Log> method
given by C<report_level>, so any value documented in L<Mojo::Log/level>
is acceptable, C<undef> disables the message. The default is C<"debug">.

You might want to set C<report_level> at least to C<"info"> if you want
this message in your production log.

=head1 METHODS

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::SizeLimit> inherits all methods from
L<Mojolicious::Plugin> and implements the following new ones.

=head2 register

  $plugin->register(Mojolicious->new);

Register plugin in L<Mojolicious> application.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 check_size

  ($total, $shared) = Mojolicious::Plugin::SizeLimit::check_size();

Returns a list with two memory sizes in KB, first to total process size
and second the shared memory size. Not exported. Most usefull for tests.
